✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and Machine Learning
This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using image processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to interpret human hand gestures captured via a webcam or images to classify them into predefined categories.

📌 Project Objective
Detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time.

Classify gestures into predefined labels.

Use image processing and machine learning (e.g., SVM or Logistic Regression).

📂 Files
Hand gesture recognition.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with all code including preprocessing, model training, and testing.

dataset/ – (Not uploaded here) Directory containing gesture image data (organized by folders per gesture).

README.md – This documentation file.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2) – For image processing and hand detection

NumPy – For numerical computations

Scikit-learn – For ML models and evaluation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – For data visualization

🧠 Workflow
Dataset Preparation

Load gesture images (e.g., numbers or custom hand signs).

Resize to uniform dimensions.

Convert to grayscale or extract features (e.g., contours, Hu moments).

Feature Extraction

Flatten image or extract relevant features.

Label data accordingly.

Train-Test Split

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training

Use classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Train the model on feature data.

Model Evaluation

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Real-Time Prediction (Optional)

Capture real-time gestures using a webcam.

Predict using the trained model.

📈 Example Results
Model trained on gestures like:

✊ Fist

✋ Palm

☝️ One finger

🤞 Two fingers

Accuracy Achieved: XX% (replace with your results)
